Rendering Components in Tkinter using pack, place and grid

pack: by default, it places components one below the other unless side parameter is used.

place: involves precise positioning. We provide x-axis and y-axis to pinpoint the location where we want to place the component.

grid: imagine the entire screen as a grid of rows and columns. It is relative to other components and not fixed like place

Recommended only to use one kind in a given GUI.
